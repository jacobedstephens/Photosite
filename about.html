                <p class="text">Hello, I'm the photographer behind the lens of your next real estate photoshoot. My name is Jacob, and I'm a 19-year-old photographer based in the beautiful city of Austin, Texas. I specialize in real estate photography, using my unique perspective to capture the essence and beauty of homes and commercial properties.</p>
                <p class="text">My passion for photography began at a young age, and I've been honing my skills for years. I attended McCallum High School right here in Austin, where I first discovered my love for capturing moments and memories with a camera. Since then, I've been working tirelessly to improve my craft and develop my own style.</p>
                <p class="text">When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me hitting the books at Austin Community College, where I'm pursuing a degree in business. I also work part-time as a server at Waterloo Icehouse, a popular restaurant in town. But even with my busy schedule, I always make time for my true passion: photography.</p>
                <p class="text">I pride myself on my ability to bring out the best in every scene, no matter the lighting or surroundings. I'm not afraid to experiment with new angles and techniques, always striving to create images that are both beautiful and unique. And if you're looking for something extra special, I even shoot with film cameras and develop the film myself at home. Yes, you read that right. I'm a bit of a photography nerd, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

                <p class="text">I’m Jacob, a real estate photographer based in Austin, Texas. I specialize in capturing homes and commercial properties with clarity, precision, and style. My goal is to showcase each space in its best light — highlighting the details that make it stand out.</p>
                <p class="text">Currently pursuing a degree in Software Development at Austin Community College, I balance my studies with my passion for visual storytelling. With experience shooting both digital and film, I bring a creative eye and technical expertise to every project.</p>
                <p class="text">Whether you’re listing a property or refreshing your brand, I’m dedicated to delivering clean, professional images that leave a lasting impression.</p>
                <p class="text">One thing that sets me apart from other photographers is my attention to detail. I believe that the little things can make a big difference in the final product. That's why I take the time to carefully review each image and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that everything is just right. From adjusting the lighting to retouching small blemishes, I'm always looking for ways to enhance the beauty of each shot.</p>
